"""
Neo4j Graph Database Client for ADEIP.

Requirements:
1. PostgreSQL is the primary system of record.
2. Neo4j is used for high-performance relationship exploration and graph queries.
3. Every graph node and relationship preserves references to source evidence IDs and event IDs.
4. Resilient: If Neo4j is temporarily unreachable, the system degrades gracefully.
